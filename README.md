Houston Bike Map

The code in this project is based off of Meteor.

This repository is a working branch of DASH.

Getting Started:

1. Install Meteor from https://www.meteor.com/

2. I recommend that you got through the documentation to make things a touch easier, located here http://docs.meteor.com/#/basic/underscore

3. From the command prompt go to your app location and run meteor by simply typing meteor.

4. Follow the instructions on screen and you are done, have fun.
